# LeetFocus

1. I will take note of amount of time spent on www.leetcode.com/*
2. I will give user 1 point for every 1 minute spent on LeetCode
3. I will deduct 5 points for every 1 minute spent on Reddit (+ Instagram + Facebook)
4. When the total number of points reduces to 0, then the user will be shown/redirected to leetcode.com
5. All set

Bonus
1. User can set from which websites they can gain points from
2. User can set from which websites they can spend their points on
3. User can decide on the parameter (5). The ratio of spend:earn
4. Have images to enchance user interface
5. Must include ONLY the tab currently using (Eg: if multiple leetcode tabs open, should not count it multiple times)
